# win/lose condition:

- when happiness score above X: win
- when happiness score below Y: lose
- add sound + visual indicators for current happiness score

# nice to have gameplay

- happy emotions try to escape the player; alternatively, they go distinct routes and the player needs to find them
- dash mechanic to destroy emotions (can also destroy happy emotions)
- negative emotions do not chase you straight away, but only when getting to close
- avoid having a horde of blue emotions chasing the player when they cannot carry more. Ideas: let them damage you + permadeath?
